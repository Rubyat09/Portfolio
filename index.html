            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                My mission is implementing visual and interactive elements that users engage with through their web browser when using a web 
                application. My mission is with the UI/UX designer and bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as well as how it works.
            </p>

        <div class="vision">
            <img src="./images/illustrators/illustrator-2.png" class="plan-image" alt="">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                As a front-end developer I need to work with designers and back-end programmers to make the UI as simple and effective as possible.
                Meanwhile, when it comes to UX, My mission is improving or enhancing the usability, accessibility, and interaction between users and products.
            </p>

        <div class="goals">
            <img src="./images/illustrators/illustrator-3.png" class="plan-image" alt="">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Front-End Developers, having learnt HTML, CSS and JS, are forced to take functionality into account when creating user experiences or making sure that the two disciplines work as one from a development perspective. They become all-rounders, having to understand what is actually happening.

                We work to advance inclusive development and equitable growth.
